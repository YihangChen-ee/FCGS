## Overview

</p>

Although various compression techniques have been proposed, previous art suffers from a common limitation: 
*for any existing 3DGS, per-scene optimization is needed to achieve compression, making the compression sluggish and slow.* 
To address this issue, we introduce Fast Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting (FCGS), 
an optimization-free model that can compress 3DGS representations rapidly in a single feed-forward pass,
which significantly reduces compression time from minutes to seconds.

## Performance

While all the other approaches are optimization-based compression which have natural advantages for a better RD performance, we still outperform most of them in an optimization-free manner for fast compression.
Our compression time is only ```1/10``` compared to others!

## Installation

We tested our code on a server with Ubuntu 20.04.1, cuda 11.8, gcc 9.4.0. We use NVIDIA L40s GPU (48G).
1. Unzip files
```
cd submodules
unzip diff-gaussian-rasterization.zip
unzip simple-knn.zip
unzip freqencoder.zip
unzip gridencoder.zip
unzip gridcreater.zip
unzip arithmetic.zip
cd ..
```
2. Install environment
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate FCGS_env
```

## Run
FCGS can *directly* compress any existing 3DGS representations to bitstreams. The input should be a *.ply* file following the format of 3DGS.

To compress a *.ply* file to bitstreams, simply run:

```
python encode_single_scene.py --lmd A_lambda --ply_path_from PATH/TO/LOAD/point_cloud.ply --bit_path_to PATH/TO/SAVE/BITSTREAMS --determ 1
```
 - ```lmd```: the trade-off parameter for size and fidelity. Chosen in [```1e-4```, ```2e-4```, ```4e-4```, ```8e-4```, ```16e-4```].
 - ```ply_path_from```: path to load the source *.ply* file.
 - ```bit_path_to```: path to save the compressed bitstreams.
 - ```determ```: see [atomic statement](https://github.com/YihangChen-ee/FCGS/blob/main/docs/atomic_statement.md)

To decompress a *.ply* file from bitstreams, simply run:

```
python decode_single_scene.py --lmd A_lambda --bit_path_from PATH/TO/LOAD/BITSTREAMS --ply_path_to PATH/TO/SAVE/point_cloud.ply
```
 - ```lmd```: the trade-off parameter for size and fidelity. Chosen in [```1e-4```, ```2e-4```, ```4e-4```, ```8e-4```, ```16e-4```].
 - ```bit_path_from```: path to load the compressed bitstreams.
 - ```ply_path_to```: path to save the decompressed *.ply* file.

### Tips
FCGS is compatible with pruning-based techniques such as [Mini-Splatting](https://github.com/fatPeter/mini-splatting) and [Trimming the fat](https://github.com/salmanali96/trimming-the-fat). You can *directly* apply FCGS to the *.ply* file output by these two approaches to further boost the compression performance.
